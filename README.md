#### About markdown display during file selection

![alt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/satokaz/vscode-memo-life-for-you/assets/images/vscode-memo_list_preview.gif)

* By entering keyword or pattern, the search results are displayed on Quick Picker.
* Open by selecting a file and move the cursor to the corresponding line and column
* selected file will be opened in the VS Code instance that executed the `Memo: Grep` command
* The file is opened with `preview` state.
* At the same time, generate `Memo Grep` output panel which outputs file list.

#### built-in ripgrep options

Picker Items is created from the output of `ripgrep` command. Therefore, picker items may not be generated correctly depending on the output. 

You do not need to install it separately to use ripgrep that ships with VS Code.

Options to use:

* `--vimgrep` -- Show results with every match on its own line, including line numbers and column numbers.
* `--color never` -- Do not use color in output.
* `-g *.md` -- Include *.md files for searching that match the given glob. 
* `-S` -- Search case insensitively if the pattern is all lowercase.

#### ripgrep configuration file (Available in vscode 1.22 or later (ripgrep 0.8.1))

You can specify options individually by preparing the ripgrep configuration file.

If `memo-life-for-you.memoGrepUseRipGrepConfigFile` is set to `true`, `$HOME/.ripgreprc (Windows example: `C:\Users\Sato\\.ripgreprc`)` is used as the configuration file.

In addition, you can specify the configuration file. To use an arbitrary file, set the absolute path of the configuration file in `memo-life-for-you.memoGrepUseRipGrepConfigFilePath`. (Example: `"memo-life-for-you.memoGrepUseRipGrepConfigFilePath": "/Users/satokaz/.vscode-ripgreprc"`)

If the configuration file does not exist, an error occurs.

The following option is mandatory;

```
--vimgrep
```

Same settings as built-in options:

```
--vimgrep
--color never
--glob=*.md
--smart-case
```

> **For windows:** From the memo command, I do not know how to write the path to execute ripgrep that is included in VS Code. Therefore, it is necessary to set the grep command individually in Windows environment.
